Cancer Center Referral Model

This project implements PCA and logistic regression to identify essential variables for securing donor funding at the Anderson Cancer Center.

Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run `python cancer_pca_logreg.py` to execute the PCA and logistic regression.
4. Results will be printed, including accuracy of the logistic regression model.

Files

- `cancer_pca_logreg.py`: Python script containing the implementation.
- `README.md`: This file.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required.

Notes

- PCA is used to reduce the dataset into 2 principal components.
- Logistic regression is implemented for predicting donor funding likelihood based on the PCA components.
